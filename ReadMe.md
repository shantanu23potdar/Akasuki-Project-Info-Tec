# Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement through Log Analysis using Large Language Models (Infosec Engineering)
## Problem Statement
In the face of increasing data volumes and complex systems, Flipkart encounters the challenge of ensuring compliance with security policies, standards, and baselines. To address this issue, this project proposes the development of a system that leverages large language models for compliance monitoring and enforcement through log analysis from relevant sources. The goal is to create a solution that can effectively analyze logs, system configurations, access controls, and user privileges to identify compliance breaches with security policies and standards. The project utilizes the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automate the process of detecting non-compliant activities and providing actionable insights for remediation.

# Solution Attributes
## The following attributes are the cornerstones of the Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement system:

Rule Definition: Distilling rules and using provided standards to establish relationships between rules and parameters in logs and policies.
Flexibility: Building a system capable of handling various log formats (CSV, text, PDF), rule sets, and compliance standards. The solution adapts to diverse environments and configurations.
Actionable Insights: Providing relevant and valuable actionable insights to facilitate effective remediation.
System Performance: Ensuring the system's efficiency and scalability to process large volumes of logs and text data.
Adaptability: Developing a system that learns from new rules, updates compliance standards, and integrates feedback for continuous improvement without requiring restarts.
High Accuracy/Precision/Recall: Enabling the system to identify compliance breaches with minimal false positives and exceptionally low false negatives.
User Interface (Optional): Offering a user-friendly interface for configuring rules, uploading logs and text files, viewing compliance reports, and accessing actionable insights.
# Application Workflow
## The workflow of the application involves the following steps:

Provide compliance documents as a ruleset alongside logs and system policies with known non-compliant activities.
The system analyzes the provided data and identifies compliance breaches.
The system generates citations pointing to specific lines, log files, and user IDs associated with the identified breaches.
Actionable insights are presented to guide users on resolving the detected compliance issues effectively.
# Technical Requirements
## The project's technical requirements include:

Utilization of an open-source Large Language Model (LLM).
Implementation of a generic tech stack for automation and parsing.
Avoidance of APIs that transmit data to third-party servers to uphold data privacy and security.
